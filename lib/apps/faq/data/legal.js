    , question: 'What is the Social Media Agreement (SMA)?'
    , answer: `
The SMLA details three main areas:
1. Licence of Content: The first key part of the SMA is a licence of content types and rights that we can together publish on FTBL. 
2. Promotion and marketing: The SMA also sets out the obligations of each party to promote FTBL to create the largest possible audience for your content on the platform. We look for firm obligations to promote the platform and your content to your existing fanbase through all of your existing channels and media outlets (digital, TV, social media and other assets).  It is important that all our partners are committed to executing an agreed promotional plan in order to encourage fan sign-up and engagement - and thereby deliver the maximum possible audience and revenues. 
3. Data Sharing: Working strictly within applicable Data Protection laws globally, we will share all permissible data on fans who follow you on the platform.  Additionally we look for access (again where permissible) to your existing fan databases in order to drive the initial take-up of the platform and promote on-going sign-ups and engagement.  One other benefit available to you is that we can give you access to actionable data science insights on your fans and their behaviour on the platform in order to provide them with truly targeted, intelligent, creative and sympathetic offers and marketing communications.  No other social media platform will share such invaluable data insights with you.  We are naturally happy to share all of this with you, because we own the business together with you.

    , question: 'What rights am I committing to FTBL?'
    , answer: 'We are not asking you to licence us anything that you are not already exploiting elsewhere, nor are we asking you to stop publishing to your existing media channels (including social media).  Essentially we are looking to work with you to publish â€“ on FTBL - the broadest, most compelling possible range of your content and media with a view to maximising your current and potential global fan-base.  We therefore seek a non-exclusive licence of everything that you have the right to publish and broadcast in social and digital media. Under our standard SMLA, you will grant a licence to all of your media and content for use on the platform, to the maximum extent possible (whilst respecting existing contractual obligations you have) as soon as each type of content becomes available to you. Remember that the more compelling your content turns out to be, the greater the level of fan engagement and the financial return to you.'

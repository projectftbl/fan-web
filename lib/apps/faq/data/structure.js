    , question: 'How is my share of the business calculated?'
    , answer: 'Our Football Members’ share of capital is awarded based on the engagement of the individual member’s content. This is calculated by an ‘Engagement Algorithm’ that measures the depth of engagement fans have across all content published on FTBL.  The Engagement Algorithm allocates the 60% equity across all Football Members. This equity allocation is then used to allocate and distribute the profits of the business every quarter. In the event that the business is sold or it floats on the Stock Market a lifetime average of the Engagement Algorithm is calculated to allocate the fixed equity for each Football Member. The equity share will drive an annual profit distribution and a capital value that is fixed and can be realized in the event of an IPO or a trade sale.  The Engagement Algorithm applies to all Football Members equally. Those Football Members that join FTBL early should gain higher average engagement and Capital Share. Football Members will be able to dispose of up to 50% of their equity at a liquidity event with an agreed sell down thereafter.'
